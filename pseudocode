for each of three hash functions
   for each of three double hash (probe increment) functions
    Initialize the table to empty
    Open the data file containing keys and associated data.
        for each key/data set read from the data file
            Call HashInsert(key, data, hashNum, dHashNum).  
               The return value from this function should be a count of the
               number of collisions encountered for this key. 
               This should be added to a running total.  HashInsert should 
               call one of the Hash functions and set the probe increment 
               to the return value from one of the  functions. This
               will result in the following 9 tests:
               1. Hash_01 using probe increment from DoubleHash_01
               2. Hash_01 using probe increment from DoubleHash_02
               3. Hash_01 using probe increment from DoubleHash_03
               4. Hash_02 using probe increment from DoubleHash_01
               5. Hash_02 using probe increment from DoubleHash_02
               6. Hash_02 using probe increment from DoubleHash_03
               7. Hash_03 using probe increment from DoubleHash_01
               8. Hash_03 using probe increment from DoubleHash_02
               9. Hash_03 using probe increment from DoubleHash_03
            Insert key and data into table
    Close data file
    Print the results of the run (total number of collisions and
         diagram of the table).
     end loop for each double hash
  end loop for each hash
